    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>  My name is Jeannell and I'm a high school senior from the Columbus, Ohio. I'm in an array of extracirriculars and community activites like AKAdettes, Model UN and have competed in ACTSO every year since my sophomore year. I have dreams of hopefully attending Southern A&M College in Baton Rouge next fall. I strive to promote unity in the black community.  </p>

  <h2> But Why?</h2>
  <ol>
      <li> <p>Let's be honest, it's hard to gain outfit inspiration from the mainstream internet without intense searching</p></li>
      <li> <p>The purpose of this website is to foster my passion for
     inspiring black women of all shapes and sizes with an array of outfit choices with
    girls that look like you</p></li>
